3. [Debugging](https://missourimrr.github.io/docs/simulation/environment-debug/windows)

## Contributing Code

### Large Files

Files larger than 100 MB must be tracked with `git-lfs`. Install `git-lfs` ([click here](https://git-lfs.com)) if you haven't installed it before, then run the following command to track a file:

```sh
git lfs track <path-to-large-file>
```

Ideally, do this *before* you run `git add` the file. You should run `git lfs track` from the root of the project.
